            <h2>My name is Katherine Guerra.</h2>
            <p>  I'm a freshman attending Pasadena High School. I was born in Pasadena California.<br> This summer I went to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Cabos">Los Cabos, Mexico</a> with my family for a vacation.<br>
                I got the chance to swim with the dolphins, and I had so much fun.<br> I also went parasailing, but in the beginning I was a
                little scared because the parasailing goes up <br>100 feet high above the ocean. 
                Finally, when I was up there and I was not afraid anymore.<br> I really enjoyed the view. It was the greatest experience 
                that I ever had.<br> I also went snorkeling under water with my family.
            </p>
