            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is one of the 
                core technologies for building web pages.<br> HTML is the language 
            for describing the structure of web pages. HTML give authors 
            the means to:
            <br>Publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc.
            <br>Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button.
            <br>Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for information, making reservations, ordering products, etc.
            <br>Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in their documents.
            <br>With HTML, authors describe the structure of pages using markup. The elements of the language label pieces of content such as “paragraph,” “list,” “table,” and so on.

            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is one of the core technologies for building Web pages.
             <br>CSS the (visual and aural) layout, for a variety of devices. CSS are the basis of building Web pages and Web Applications.
             <br> CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. 
             <br>It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. 
             <br>CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.<br> The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments.
             <br>This is referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from presentation.</p>
